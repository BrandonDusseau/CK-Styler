This stylesheet will modify the styles of Dr. C-K Shene's webpages such that
their readability is improved.

This requires the Stylish browser extension to be installed.

Currently supported browsers:
 * Mozilla Firefox
 * Google Chrome
 * Safari

To activate style, simply create a style and paste the contents of the
appropriate CSS file into your browser. Depending on your browser,
it may be necessary to follow additional instructions inside the CSS
file.

For Safari, you can install this third party fork of Stylish: http://sobolev.us/stylish/.
Safari users should use chrome.css for their stylesheet.
